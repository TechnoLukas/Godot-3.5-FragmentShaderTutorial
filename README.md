Fragment Shader Tutorial Series in One Godot Project (GLES 2.0) based on GLSL 2D Tutorials of Shadertoy by Ugur Guney

Hi Every One,

This is a converted and interpreted set of shaders compatible Godot Shader Language (GLES 2.0) in One Godot Project.
Thanks to Uğur Güney's efforts from 2014 to 2020. https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Md23DV. It is said it was popular in GLSL Sandbox for while.

It is a template for an organised study medium as my own self-tutorial and for the next ones.

Note: "Book of Shaders in One Godot Project" is in preparatory stage. Website sections completed. Image Processing" section in PDF remainded only.

What has been done and not done
- a Pure Black 200 x 113 pixels PNG created as a texture base for shaded sprites not to use scaling in Godot.
- textures in sprites flipped vertically, because y axis positive direction from top to bottom in Godot, unlike in Shadertoy except "27 MOUSE INPUT".
- one Shadertoy file divided into 29 shader resources file in one folder, because "option structure" such as below cannot be trackable for a long text in Godot Shader easily.
	- #define TUTORIAL 0
	- #if TUTORIAL == 0
	- .........
	- #endif
- all #define terms converted into const ...
- uniform vec2 iResolution = vec2(200.0, 113.0); defined and declared in each shader resource
- fragCoord converted into UV equivalent.
- iTime converted into TIME.
- nested ternaries changed if / else if structure, because Godot GLES 2.0 does not support nested one.
- mat2(x ,y ,z ,w ) structure changed to mat2(vec2(x , y), vec2(z ,w )) structure, otherwise Godot GLES 2.0 does not support.
- in GLES 2.0, both global and local variables definition with same name is not supported. So, they all changed accordingly.
- fragColor converted into COLOR.
- similar 3 Textures found and implemented instead of 3 iChannel Textures.
- different mouse interaction structure organised within GdScript (imouse.gd) to compare iMouse(vec4) in Shadertoy. It can be examined.
- some lines from Shadertoy kept as commented for logic comparison.
- System structured as shown pictures below.
- "esc", "Q" keys, "mouse left click" and "mouse move" intervene in run window.
- main imperfection is not to transport shader codes into run screen as a pair with the result shaded tile. You can check that easily in editor via folders.

Hope this helpful.
